# ActiveRecord Associations - One to Many

### Learning Goals:
- [] Recognize the connection between the primary key - foreign key relationship and ActiveRecord associations
- [] Implement a one to many association between two models
- [] Implement a one to one association between two models
- [] Read and understand documentation on ActiveRecord association methods

## Topics

### What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?

...
### If we have a one to many relationship between two tables, which table gets the foreign key?

...
### Association methods are which kind of methodsâ€“instance methods or class methods?

...

## Help me build this out

- Create `Walk` model and associated `walks` table
- open up `./bin/console` and do create a couple of dogs.

## Task 1 - belongs_to

1. Create an `issues` table with the following columns:

- title (string)
- description (string)
- resolved (boolean)
- started_at (datetime)
- computer (belongs_to)

2. In `lib/issue.rb`, create an `Issue` class that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` 

3. Use an ActiveRecord association macro to create a relationship between an issue and a computer. Which type of relationship should you add here?

4. Enter `./bin/console` and create a couple of issues for the `first_computer`. Use Sqlite Explorer to check your database to ensure the issues are created.

### Discussion Questions
#### How did you create the issues table? 

...

#### How would you describe the relationship between an issue and a computer?

...
#### When you use the association method to access the related computer, what does the SQL query look like?

...


## Help me build this out

- Finish adding the one-to-many relationship between `Dog <== Walk`


## Task 2 - has_many

1. Update the Computer class to add an ActiveRecord association method that relates the Computer model to the Issue model.

2. Open up `./bin/console` and use it to create an issue for a computer and then access that computer and view all of its issues. Confirm that you're able to call a method on either the issue or the computer and see the other object in the return value.

### Discussion Questions

#### What are the database requirements for a has_many relationship? 

...
#### What about the belongs_to relationship?

...
#### What other examples of one-to-many relationships can you think of?
